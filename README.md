# AOOD Group Project

Welcome to AOOD Group Project! This group project was created with the collaboration of 9 prospective software engineers in high school from January to March 2022.

The team utilized the Java Swing library and XML files to create a study-assist graphical user interface.

The project was intended to practice group methodologies such as the the Waterfall model (see [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/waterfall-model/)) and imitate roles such as the Lead Engineer.
